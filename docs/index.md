This is a guide with specific steps on how to create a digital grammar.
The proposed method uses the [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/)/[CLLD](https://clld.org/) ecosystem to combine a linguistic database with a document written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
It uses software specifically developed for this approach, as well as a set of [CLDF components](https://github.com/fmatter/cldf-ldd/tree/main).
As such, it is opinionated in its choice of tools; however, the formatted output is [customizable](https://fl.mt/pylingdocs/extending/).
In principle, the same method could be applied to other types of linguistic databases, provided that tooling for integrating data into schematic templates is available for these databases.[^1]

## Next steps

1. make sure you have [the necessary setup](/start)
2. acquire [a CLDF dataset](/data)
3. [write](/pld) a description

## Problems?

1. please check first if your case is covered in the [common problems](/faq#common-problems)
2. if it's clear that the error comes from one of the used python packages, click the respective link ([cldflex](https://github.com/fmatter/cldflex/issues/new), [unboxer](https://github.com/fmatter/unboxer/issues/new), [pylingdocs](https://github.com/fmatter/pylingdocs/issues/new), [indicogram](https://github.com/fmatter/indicogram/issues/new)) to create an issue
3. [describe your issue here](https://github.com/fmatter/digital-grammar-tutorial/issues/new)
